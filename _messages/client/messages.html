<p>Hi, {{to.first_name}}</p>

<p>Hope all is well with you. My name is Moshe from World Trade Copiers.</p>

<p>My colleague Norman explained to me that {{to.customer.name}} has {{equipment to.customer._id}} copiers, and the lease on them is set to expire very soon.</p>

<p>We’d love to see if we can provide you better value. Here are just a few of the services we offer:
<ul>
<li>Guaranteed 4-hour service responses or a 25% refund on your bill</li>
<li>20% to 40% savings on maintenance</li>
<li>Optimize technologies we sell to meet the needs of your business</li>
<li>Lease buy outs, to replace your old equipment with brand-new machines</li>
</ul>
<p>{{to.first_name}}, please let me know if we could set up a time to talk at your convenience?</p>

<p>I’d be interested in learning more about your business, so we could discuss how we can help meet your needs.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>
